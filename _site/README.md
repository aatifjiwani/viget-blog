<h1 align="center"><a href="https://aatifjiwani.github.io/">Viget Internship Blog</a></h1>
<p align="center">This is an updated daily blog <strong>(until August 10th, 2018)</strong> where I post things I did during the day, new things I've learned, and things I need help on</p>

## Implementation
I used Github Pages and the Jekyll blog framework in order to create this site. I, of course, replaced the default styling and layout with my own markup in order to account for the features I want to implement. 

## Features
- About page explaining who I am and what I do
- Sitemap for all the blogs currently posted in a filtered order
- Ability to scroll through the 10-week timeframe using buttons <strong>(implemented with vanilla Javascript)</strong>
