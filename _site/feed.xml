I didn’t have a crap-ton of meetings to go to which was nice. 
Today, I learned quite a bit more about Ruby on Rails and Heroku. When you migrate your database locally, apparently heroku does
not detect the changes. So you need to tell heroku to migrate the db on their server or something which is weird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I made hella progress with Haxxor News. Eli assigned me the task to allow visitors to create a new article and view the most recently posted articles for the first week. I finished pretty much both of those tasks today which I’m pretty proud of. It was supposed to take a week but I got it done pretty fast. However, I’m not necessarily done. I want visitors to be able to add more content to their article rather than just a simple title and body. Maybe I’ll figure out how users can add images to the article and also some other stuff I need to figure out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other news, I taught Eli how to play Fortnite lol:&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve added a photo of myself to the about page to add some more pizzaz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I have a new project. Yay!! I get to build a recreation of &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.ycombinator.com&quot;&gt; Hacker News&lt;/a&gt; which is pretty sweet. I started to work on deploying the app and getting the preliminary design of the home page finished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst doing so, I learnt a couple things. First, Heroku is a PAIN IN THE ASS!!!!!! Just trying to deploy the app on Heroku took like an hour or so because I was getting so many errors. There is just so many things you have to configure before your app is working successfully on Heroku.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I learnt more things about Ruby on Rails. I figured out (with the help of Eli) that each HTML page is actually a template that is passed into the application.html.erb file. I also learned that in the application controller, you can write:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;some_method&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;helper_method&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:some_method&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and you can use the given method inside your view. That’s so cool!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, I am going to work on creating a model for the posts and allowing visitors to be able to create and view a list of the most recent posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See ya tomorrow!!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="first" /><summary type="html">Today I finished my blog in its entirety (if that’s spelled correctly).

It was quite an eventful day as I learnt a lot of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I had a meeting with Peyton to discuss how I could better design my blog. He definitely gave me some great pointers which I’ve implemented. Now, the header is Viget blue and the footer is Viget orange. Everything is pretty much Viget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing he did recommend was putting the buttons that are currently on the home page. Despite that being a great idea, holy crap that was hard to implement. Javascript sucks (Sorry REACT devs) and it was pretty frustrating to figure everything out. However, it does seem I’ve got the basic functionality down. There is a weird thing that happens where once I press a button, the fade in and fade out isn’t necessarily smooth. I’m gonna have to ask Prayash about it tomorrow and see if we can fix anything. Also, my JS code is kinda messy so I’m going to also see if there is a way to clean it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, this concludes my blog post.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="first" /><summary type="html">Hey ya’ll I just finished my fourth day at Viget.

Today I had a meeting at 8:30 AM for the Intro to Business Dev and that sucked. Not the content or the people in the meeting, just the fact that I had to pull myself out of bed at 6:00 AM to get to the meeting on time. I don’t really like waking up early because I’m a night owl and not a morning riser but sometimes you gotta do what’s expected of you. It’s all good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After playing around with Jekyll for a little while, I finally have the entire framework down. I know how to override the default layouts given by Jekyll and I figured out how the templating works. Jekyll uses Liquid templating which sounds dumb and horrible and the mathematical operations are absolutely wack. Instead of writing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you have to write&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;modulo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isn’t that dumb?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welp, that’s it for this post.

This is my second day at Viget and it’s going really well so far. 
Today, I had a lot of meetings but it was quite fun. It was nice to be able to 
immerse myself in what a real-life office scenario would look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, Eli gave me an assignment to create this blog so here it is lmao. Honestly, I was a little
afraid that I was not going to be able to understand how Jekyll works because I’ve never heard of it but
I think I got the hang of it. It’s kinda funky and not like an web framework that I’ve ever had to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, my blog looks pretty bland and I hope to be able to work with Peyton on making the design better
with his help in CSS styling. I would if I could but front-end is a pain in my butt and I really don’t want to tinker
with it for hours to make sure all my formatting is correct.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="first" /><summary type="html">Hey!
