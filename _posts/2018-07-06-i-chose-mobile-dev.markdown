Ahh, what a relaxing lil break I just had celebrating our country and my mom's birthday. Now, it's time to get back to work! Today was kinda busy and I wasn't able to really get grunt work done since I was in a couple standups and we had FLF. However, what I was able to do was talk to Prayash about where to go from here. I learned a lot from the little session we had because he showed me the quirks of React and how it is awesome but also how mobile development in pure Swift looks like.

So I've made a decision. In my eyes as a developer, when I am learning new things, I like to take the hard route. I like learning all the nitty-gritty basics and how to create something by using as little of external libraries as possible. Therefore, for the rest of my internship, I want to start building an app for iOS using pure Swift. I chose this because I want to master the basics of app development and then be able to take it a step further and use React native for future applications. This allows me to learn the concept of building mobile apps without taking the easy way like React allows you to kinda do. Easy meaning that there are things to make your life easier as a developer which is what React pretty much is. 

Also, I've been able to update the READMEs on my github repositories so other employers or visitors can see what the actual repo is for without digging through all the code and extraneous files. 

Later today, I am going to edit some of the backend for This or That in order to include the ability to have your polls expire after a given amount of time. This should be pretty easy and not something that will take long. 

Otherwise, see you next week!!!
