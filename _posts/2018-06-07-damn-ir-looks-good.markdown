Hey ya'll I just finished my fourth day at Viget. It was quite an eventful day as I learnt a lot of things. 

First, I had a meeting with Peyton to discuss how I could better design my blog. He definitely gave me some great pointers which I've implemented. Now, the header is Viget blue and the footer is Viget orange. Everything is pretty much Viget. 

One thing he did recommend was putting the buttons that are currently on the home page. Despite that being a great idea, holy crap that was hard to implement. Javascript sucks (Sorry REACT devs) and it was pretty frustrating to figure everything out. However, it does seem I've got the basic functionality down. There is a weird thing that happens where once I press a button, the fade in and fade out isn't necessarily smooth. I'm gonna have to ask Prayash about it tomorrow and see if we can fix anything. Also, my JS code is kinda messy so I'm going to also see if there is a way to clean it up. 

Otherwise, this concludes my blog post.
