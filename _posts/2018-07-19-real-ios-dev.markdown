Today pretty much consisted of doing one thing: iOS Development. At first, I was going to just try to complete the tutorial from Brian Voong on Let's Build That App on YouTube but I realized something. After almost watching like 25 30-minute videos of just developing a fake app, I got kind of tired of listening to his voice. At this point, I really want to start developing an app that would be fun like the one for ThisOrThat, and so I did.

In reality, I didn't do much coding today. I was just really working on the branding and the launch screen of the app. I got the logos and the files I need from Julia so I went ahead and started to create the basic layout. One thing I learned is that there ARE A LOT, A LOT of different app icons you need to put into Xcode. Different meaning different sizes and it definitely was a hassle to keep exporting the same image over and over again at different sizes. 

Also, I learned that you can create the launch screen in a storyboard but you can't create it programatically. I think Apple did this on purpose because the launch screen is just meant to be static and there isn't supposed to be any form of functionality whatsoever. Another thing I learned was that STORYBOARDS SUCK!!!! They're so confusing and constraints are so gosh darn hard to add. It's not that making the layout in a storyboard is hard, it is just super confusing. There are so many buttons and windows that it really hurts my brain. This is why I'd rather stick to coding it because there are no buttons or extra windows, it's just my code. 

That's pretty much all I did today! See ya tomorrow!
