Today wasn't that bad honestly. I didn't really work on the group project because I'm still waiting on Peyton's stuff and no one reviewed my PR that I put up yesterday. That kinda sucks because the PR isn't that big and it would be nice to be able to finally merge that branch into master so I don't have to worry about it ever again. 

So instead of the group project, I continued following the tutorial on how to create a basic chat app. I surprisingly didn't run into any problems but now I realized something: This app is getting complex. It's getting harder to figure out what is where and what does what exactly. All my stuff is organized but there is already so much code that it gets harder to think about how to fix something that may be wrong. 

I didn't really learn anything new today besides the history of audio recording (Thanks Riley) and I simply continued developing this mobile app. 
Also, this marks the end of the 6th week of my Viget internship and this is nuts!!!! I can't beliebe all this time is flying by and I really wish I could stay here longer and get paid to code. 

Cya next week!
