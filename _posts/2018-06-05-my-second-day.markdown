Hey! This is my second day at Viget and it's going really well so far. 
Today, I had a lot of meetings but it was quite fun. It was nice to be able to 
immerse myself in what a real-life office scenario would look like. 

Also, Eli gave me an assignment to create this blog so here it is lmao. Honestly, I was a little
afraid that I was not going to be able to understand how Jekyll works because I've never heard of it but
I think I got the hang of it. It's kinda funky and not like an web framework that I've ever had to use. 

Right now, my blog looks pretty bland and I hope to be able to work with Peyton on making the design better
with his help in CSS styling. I would if I could but front-end is a pain in my butt and I really don't want to tinker
with it for hours to make sure all my formatting is correct.
