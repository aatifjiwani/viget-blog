Ahhh, today was pretty relaxed compared to last week. I didn't have a crap-ton of meetings to go to which was nice. 
Today, I learned quite a bit more about Ruby on Rails and Heroku. When you migrate your database locally, apparently heroku does
not detect the changes. So you need to tell heroku to migrate the db on their server or something which is weird. 

Also, I made hella progress with Haxxor News. Eli assigned me the task to allow visitors to create a new article and view the most recently posted articles for the first week. I finished pretty much both of those tasks today which I'm pretty proud of. It was supposed to take a week but I got it done pretty fast. However, I'm not necessarily done. I want visitors to be able to add more content to their article rather than just a simple title and body. Maybe I'll figure out how users can add images to the article and also some other stuff I need to figure out. 

In other news, I taught Eli how to play Fortnite lol:
