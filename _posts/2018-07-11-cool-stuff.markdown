Today I didn't do much besides start the second iOS tutorial for creating a simple chat app. Don't take that the wrong way because I spent the entire day doing that and I gotta admit it was pretty fun. The tutorial introduced me to Google Firebase which is actually a really nice way for authenticating users. So if I ever need to have users in my mobile app, Firebase here I come. 

One new thing I did in this tutorial besides implementing text fields and Firebase was adding gestures. adding Gestures, if I am getting this right, are for elements that are not buttons and you can trigger an event from any element based on any gesture. At first, I had a problem with my code because I defined and added the gesture within the instantiation block. However, I guess you can't do that anymore with Swift 4 and I had to move the adding and registering the gesture down to where I add the specific view as a subview. 

That's pretty much it so this blog is kinda short. That's okay maybe I'll make up for it tomorrow.
