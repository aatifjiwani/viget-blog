Oh, hello there. I see you've stumbled onto my about page. 

A little about me: My name is Aatif Jiwani and I'm a rising sophomore at UC Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I am currently the Rails Developer (Dev) Intern at Viget in their Boulder office. 

I don't really know what else you should know about me so I'll just list some basic stuff:

<strong>Favorite song:</strong> Holiday by Green Day <br>
<strong>Favorite movie:</strong> Straight Outta Compton <br>
<strong>Favorite color:</strong> Red (sorry Viget, don't tell Erica)


And that's everything you should know about me!
